A man came across this old tower one day
It was straight like from a book he once read
He lifted his head up and saw this young lady
And here's what the lady said

Moi je m'appelle mademoiselle noir
Et comme vous pouvez le voir
Je ne souris, ni ris, ni vis
Et c'est tout ce qu'elle a dit

The man was so scared he could only run away
He ran to the town and then said
I just saw a lady with the longest dark hair
And I think she's a living dead!

The people, so scared, took their guns and their swords
They ran to the tower and then
They saw the pale lady and felt a great fear
When they heard how she said it again

Moi je m'appelle mademoiselle noir
Et comme vous pouvez le voir
Je ne souris, ni ris, ni vis
Et c'est tout ce qu'elle a dit

The people, they knew what this all was about
She was clearly a demon from hell
They decided to set her long hair on fire
In the end it would burn her as well
But the lady was no demon she was a lonely soul
Just like in that book they once read
Still waiting for her prince while her hair was on fire
The one last time she said

Moi je m'appelle mademoiselle noir
Et comme vous pouvez le voir
Je ne souris, ni ris, ni vis
Et c'est tout ce qu'elle a dit
